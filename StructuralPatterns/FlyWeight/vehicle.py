class Vehicle:
    """
    A class to represent a vehicle in a traffic simulation.
    This class uses the Flyweight design pattern by storing shared intrinsic properties
    in a flyweight object and maintaining unique extrinsic properties separately.

    Attributes:
        flyweight (VehicleFlyweight): The flyweight object containing shared properties.
        position (tuple): The current position of the vehicle (e.g., (x, y) coordinates).
        destination (tuple): The destination position of the vehicle (e.g., (x, y) coordinates).
    """

    def __init__(self, flyweight, position, destination):
        """
        Initializes a new Vehicle object with the specified flyweight, position, and destination.

        Parameters:
            flyweight (VehicleFlyweight): The flyweight object containing shared properties.
            position (tuple): The current position of the vehicle.
            destination (tuple): The destination position of the vehicle.
