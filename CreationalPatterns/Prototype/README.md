# ü§ñ  Prototype Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Prototype is a design pattern for creation that allows you to clone existing objects without tying your code to their specific classes.
## üö® The Problem
Imagine you possess an object and want to replicate it exactly. What's the procedure? Initially, you'd craft a fresh object from the same class. Following that, you'd need to navigate through every attribute of the initial object, transferring their data to this new creation.

Sounds straightforward? Well, there's a twist. Copying isn't always straightforward since certain attributes within the object could be private, making them inaccessible externally.

Direct copying presents another hiccup. By needing to recognize the object's class to replicate it, your code becomes tethered to that specific class. And if that dependency isn't concerning enough, consider this: there might be instances when you're familiar only with the interface the object adheres to, not its actual class. This is particularly true in scenarios where a method's parameter can accommodate any object abiding by a specific interface.
## ‚úîÔ∏è The Solution
The Prototype pattern entrusts the task of replication to the very objects being duplicated. It establishes a unified interface for all cloneable objects. This design enables the duplication of an object without binding your code to its specific class, typically with a singular "clone" method present in the interface.

The essence of the clone method remains fairly consistent across different classes. This method forms an object from the present class and transfers all attributes from the original object to the newly formed one. Interestingly, even private attributes can be duplicated, as many programming languages grant objects the privilege to access private attributes of fellow objects within the same class.

Such a cloneable object is termed a "prototype." Especially when your objects have a multitude of attributes and various configurations, cloning can be a preferable alternative to creating subclasses. 
In practice, this involves setting up a collection of objects, each configured distinctively. Should you require an object mirroring a pre-existing configuration, you merely replicate the prototype rather than building an entirely new entity.
## üöß Structural Elements
- **Prototype**: The Prototype interface sets forth methods for duplication, typically represented by a lone "clone" method.
- **Concrete Prototype**: The Concrete Prototype class realizes the duplication method. While it primarily transfers data from the original to the clone, this method might also address specific complexities tied to replicating linked objects or resolving recursive dependencies.
- **Client**: The Client has the capability to generate duplicates of any object adhering to the prototype interface.
## Implementation Guide
Implementation Guide:

1. **Setting up the Prototype**: Initiate a prototype interface, incorporating the clone method. If an existing class hierarchy is present, you can add the method to its classes.
   
2. **Prototype Class Construction**: 
   - This class should feature an alternate constructor accepting an object of its own class. This constructor is tasked with copying the attributes of the passed object to the new instance.
   - If working with a subclass, invoke the parent constructor to facilitate the superclass in copying its private attributes.
   
3. **Method Overloading Considerations**: 
   - If your programming environment doesn't back method overloading, you'll be restricted from developing a distinct prototype constructor. Consequently, copying data to the new clone will necessitate execution within the clone method. 
   - Nonetheless, embedding this logic within a standard constructor is deemed more reliable, ensuring the object, once the new operator is activated, is ready to use.

4. **Cloning Method Essentials**: 
   - Typically, this method encapsulates a single action: invoking a new operator combined with the prototype-specific constructor. 
   - Each class should independently override the cloning method, pairing the new operator with its unique class name. Neglecting this may result in the generation of a parent class object through the cloning method.

5. **Prototype Registry (Optional)**: 
   - Consider establishing a centralized registry to catalog prototypes that are frequently utilized.
   - This registry can be structured as a distinct factory class or integrated within the foundational prototype class, accompanied by a static method for prototype retrieval. 
   - When a request is made, based on provided search parameters or a simple string descriptor, the method should locate the relevant prototype, clone it, and dispatch the duplicate to the requester.

6. **Refinement**: 
   - Conclude by substituting direct invocation of subclass constructors with calls directed at the prototype registry's factory method.
