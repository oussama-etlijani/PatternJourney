# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that allows the creation of families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## The Problem

In a furniture shop simulator, you might have families of related products, like Chair, Sofa, and CoffeeTable, and variants of these families (Modern, Victorian, ArtDeco). The challenge is creating individual furniture objects that match others of the same family, without having to modify existing code when adding new products or families of products.

## The Solution

The Abstract Factory pattern advocates declaring interfaces for each distinct product of the product family (chair, sofa, coffee table, etc.). Variants of products adhere to these interfaces. Following that, the Abstract Factory—an interface with a list of creation methods for all products that are part of the product family—is declared.

For each product family variant, a separate factory class based on the AbstractFactory interface is created. For example, ModernFurnitureFactory can create ModernChair, ModernSofa, and ModernCoffeeTable objects.

## Structural Elements

- **Abstract Products**: These declare interfaces for a set of related products that make up a product family.
- **Concrete Products**: These are implementations of abstract products, grouped by variants.
- **Abstract Factory**: This interface declares a set of methods for creating each of the abstract products.
- **Concrete Factories**: These implement creation methods of the abstract factory. Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific variant of products and creates only those product variants.

The client code works with both factories and products via their respective abstract interfaces, which allows changing the type of factory and product variant without breaking the client code.

## Example

An application of the Abstract Factory pattern could be the creation of cross-platform UI elements. Concrete factories correspond to specific operating systems and create UI elements that match that OS. Upon launching, the application checks the type of the current operating system and uses this information to create a factory object from a class that matches the OS. The rest of the code then uses this factory to create UI elements, thus ensuring that the wrong elements are not created.

The Abstract Factory design pattern provides an efficient way to create families of related objects, thus enhancing code modularity and making it more flexible and maintainable.
