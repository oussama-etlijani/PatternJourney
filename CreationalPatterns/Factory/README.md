# Factory Method Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that is often used to provide a level of abstraction to the process of object creation. Instead of calling the constructors directly to create objects, this pattern suggests that we use a special factory method to create them.

## The Problem

In a software development process, the coupling between classes can make the codebase complex and hard to maintain. For example, in a logistics management application, if the code is heavily coupled to a `Truck` class, adding a new `Ship` class would require extensive changes to the codebase. Furthermore, adding more types of transportation would demand the same kind of laborious code modifications, making the code full of conditionals and difficult to read and manage.

## The Solution

The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but it allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This might seem like a small change, but it offers a significant amount of flexibility. By calling a factory method to create objects, we can change the type of object created by overriding the factory method in a subclass. This lets us introduce new types of products into the program without breaking the existing client code.

## Structural Elements

- **Product**: The product declares the common interface for objects that the factory method creates.
- **Concrete Products**: These are various implementations of the product interface.
- **Creator**: This class declares the factory method that returns new product objects. Its main function is not to create products, but it houses some core business logic related to products. The factory method assists in decoupling this logic from the concrete product classes.
- **Concrete Creators**: These classes override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.

## Example

An example of the Factory Method pattern could be the creation of cross-platform User Interface (UI) elements. The Factory Method can be used to create these elements without coupling the client code to the concrete UI classes. This way, the base dialog class uses different UI elements to render its window without rewriting the logic for each operating system, by declaring a factory method to produce buttons, for instance. Hence, it can later create a subclass that returns Windows-styled buttons from the factory method.

The Factory Method design pattern provides an efficient way to decouple the client code from concrete classes, thus making your code more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain.
